# Bullets / Collide Glass

# When a bullets touches an glass block, it will have 1/5 chances to break it. But the glass is always touched twice because the collisions are calculated every half block
# So if each collisions has 1/5 chances to break the glass, the 2 collisions will have 1/3 chances to break it (Bernoulli's law)
