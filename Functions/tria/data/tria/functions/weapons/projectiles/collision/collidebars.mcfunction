# Projectiles / Collide Bars

# When a bullets touches an bars block, it will have 1/5 chances to be killed it. But the bars are always touched twice because the collisions are calculated every half block
# So if each collisions has 1/5 chances to kill the projectile, the 2 collisions will have 1/3 chances to kill it (Bernoulli's law)
